// find out if possible
-"repair-based" BFS (re-using BFS field as cache structure and repair changed values on involved Fields)


-undo/redo (for placing and loading)


-- extended properties / statistics thingy on UI (so it doesn't get too crammed up)

-better pruning of unreachable fields

-improve prio checks ´n such

-dynamic cache sizing?


-GPU solver (needs completely new implementation. maybe int[] based.)
->
-array for pred (or just direction?)
-another array for type (ice, WPs [maybe one per WP?]) -> read only


-make it faster

	// TODO

	/**
	 * initial mark for blocking to find exclusions
	 * initial mark and other stuff at mazeDescriptor level, not Fields
	 * separate solving from rest (separate solver for each maze)
	 * class for solver strategy?
	 * make double/tripple recurse more iterative
